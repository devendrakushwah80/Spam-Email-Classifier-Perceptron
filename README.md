# 📧 Spam Email Classifier using Perceptron

This project is a simple Machine Learning model that classifies emails as **Spam or Not Spam** using the Perceptron algorithm.

It is a beginner friendly project made using Scikit-learn.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project:

- Email text data is preprocessed
- Text is converted into numerical form using TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Perceptron model is trained
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

- Perceptron (Linear Binary Classifier)

Why Perceptron?
Because it is simple and good for understanding how linear classifiers work.
